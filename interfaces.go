Package augmentedtree is designed to be useful when checking
for intersection of ranges in n-dimensions.  For instance, if you imagine
an xy plane then the augmented tree is for telling you if
plane defined by the points (0, 0) and (10, 10).  The augmented
tree can tell you if that plane overlaps with a plane defined by
(-5, -5) and (5, 5) (true in this case).  You can also check
intersections against a point by constructing a range of encompassed
solely if a single point.

The current tree is a simple top-down red-black binary search tree.

TODO: Add a bottom-up implementation to assist with duplicate
range handling.
